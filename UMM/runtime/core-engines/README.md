## **Overview**

The **Core Engines** are the constitutional execution layer of the Unified Meta‑Model (UMM).  
They implement the structural guarantees defined in the **UMM Constitution** and enforced at runtime by the **Compassion Runtime Engine**.

Each engine is responsible for one dimension of constitutional stability:

- boundaries  
- continuity  
- identity  
- epochal motion  
- constitutional compliance  

Together, they form the backbone of the Runtime Plane.

Each engine has:

- a spec file  
- an interface file  
- a minimal example  
- integration notes for the Runtime Plane

## **Engine Summaries**

### **Boundary Engine**  
**Purpose:** Enforce non‑coercive boundaries.

Responsibilities:

- validate access requests  
- ensure operations respect user boundaries  
- prevent coercive or collapsing interactions  
- integrate with Compassion Kernel boundary checks  

Spec: **Boundary Engine**

---

### **Continuity Engine**  
**Purpose:** Maintain coherent motion across states.

Responsibilities:

- commit tonal transitions  
- enforce gentle pacing  
- prevent abrupt or disorienting shifts  
- maintain continuity across scaffolds  

Spec: **Continuity Engine**

---

### **Identity Engine**  
**Purpose:** Protect identity integrity.

Responsibilities:

- preserve user identity state  
- prevent erasure, distortion, or forced redefinition  
- ensure identity continuity across transitions  
- integrate with Compassion Kernel identity checks  

Spec: **Identity Engine**

---

### **Epoch Engine**  
**Purpose:** Manage macro‑state transitions.

Responsibilities:

- handle epoch shifts  
- maintain versioning and long‑range continuity  
- log macro‑transitions  
- enforce epoch stability clauses  

Spec: **Epoch Engine**

---

### **Constitutional Engine**  
**Purpose:** Enforce the UMM Constitution at runtime.

Responsibilities:

- validate operations against constitutional principles  
- ensure non‑coercion, non‑collapse, and mutuality  
- coordinate with Compassion Runtime Engine  
- block unconstitutional operations  

Spec: **Constitutional Engine**

The Core Engines are the **execution layer** that turns constitutional principles into actual runtime behavior.

## **Integration Points**

### **With Compassion Runtime Engine**
All engines receive pre‑validated operations from the Runtime Engine.  
They never bypass compassion checks.

### **With Kernel Plane**
Engines commit operations only after Kernel invariants (Spark, Mesh, Pulse) are satisfied.

### **With Tonal Scaffolds**
Continuity Engine uses scaffolds as the canonical state machine.

### **With Logs**
All engines write to:

```
/UMM/runtime/logs/
```

for debugging, amendment review, and stability analysis.

## **Minimal Example**

See: **Minimal Interaction Trace**  
This shows a full loop from user → Mimi → Runtime Engine → Core Engines → Kernel.
